TiWinSlider is a quick implementation of sliding windows as found in the Facebook iOS and Path iOS app. 

TiWinSlider is in no way connected to either of the above mentioned apps in any way.

It still is a little buggy but definitely ready for ad-hoc testing.

Following is the video of it in excercise <http://cl.ly/EPiS>.

##### Update
1. I have updated the entire code set. All the sliding magic(for pros, I am talking about eventListeners, etc) is all included in the slider.js file. This makes it easier for you to simply pick up the code and use it in your project. 

2. I have added a few variables which can be edited in the slider.js file to suit your requirements.

3. Added an example to show how to switch between windows using this method.
